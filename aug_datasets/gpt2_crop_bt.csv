Dr Mayengbam Lalit Singh Recently honourable PM of India launched scheme called  Doubling Farmers  Income  in order to uplift the welfare being of larger portion of Indians  The big questions felt by people are  i  How would it be possible in short period of time  And  ii  is it an elusive doctrine to sweep vote bank of millions of farmers for upcoming parliamentary election in   Across all over India  except for a few states  so many rigidities have to be solved in order to raise the real income of farmers  These rigidities are characterised by infrastructures  structures and institutions  The present article focuses on those rigidities only for Manipur which has been lagging behind many Indian states  Regarding infrastructure  inputs   the state is found backward among those backward states of India  Introspecting water infrastructure  the state has been underutilising water resources despite the abundant availability  For Kharif season crops farmers rely on rain water since the state is under the map of SE monsoon  However  during Rabi and Zayed seasons the state has been witnessing scarcity of water  In order to curb this shortage  government needs construction of multiple check dams and digging bore wells in those small streams flowing across the plain areas  During peak season  there is always a shortage of manures and pesticides due to landslide on national highways  Revolution of organic farming will lessen dependency on chemical fertilisers since the state has high potential of producing organic manures and pesticides  During post harvesting period  the state needs to construct cold storages so that perishable crops can be stored for agricultural off seasons  Regarding financial support to farming  banks are not integrated with farmers  Moreover state government does not organise crop insurance schemes in order to compensate the loss due to natural calamity  My previous article on  Channelizing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act  MGNREGA  with Crop and Livestock Insurances in India  postulates the model on how to compensate the loss  The second rigid character of farming is that there had been no structural change over decades  Farming in Manipur focuses on production of only coarse cereals which is characterised by immediate consumption  In this era of globalisation farming should have close introspection of demand and supply model of consumers across the world  Especially in hilly areas  cultivation of coarse cereal is just to meet local consumption and not for earning profits  Nowadays  farmers stated cultivation of illegal crops such as poppy illegally in order to earn huge profit  In order to prevent this  government should emphasise on cultivation cash crops such yongchak  parkia speciosa   cardamom  tea  coffee  black pepper  etc since these crops are highly demanded in international as well as domestic market  On the other hand this can reduce environmental destruction which is followed after short period zoom cultivation  In plain areas also main crops are also coarse cereals which are vulnerable to low profit  Farmers should diversify in cultivation of cash crops such as black rice  medicinal plants  oil seeds  mushrooms  etc  Moreover farmers should engage themselves in nonfarm sectors wherein both farm and nonfarm sectors can be fitted in supply and demand schedule for their inputs and outputs  One of the institutional rigidities faced by the farmers is asymmetric information on the technological development in agricultural sector  Krishi Vigyan Kendras  KVKs  had been instituted in every districts across India in order to fill the information gap between farmers and agricultural scientists  However their works had been found confined to laboratories only and their expertises are hardly in the knowledge domain of farmers  Government should frame policies for KVKs so that they should be available to farmers at least once in a week on alternative blocks  Another institutional rigidity we witness is financial inaccessibility of farmers to existing financial institutions  banks   In India  banks are found to release funds to manufacturing and service sectors but not on agricultural sector  Too much official procedures and rigid financial securities create inaccessibility of farmers to banks  So the banks should be advised to make survey on the constructive environment wherein farmers should accede and return loans in time  Another important institutional rigidity is lack of marketing institutions such as marketing farms and agents which can deal in such agricultural products  Government should invite both local and nonlocal farms which can link farmers with consumers at price determined by market rate  Government also should have policies such as Minimum Support Price and construction of Cold Storages so that various types of agricultural products can be available during their offseason  The last most important institutional rigidities is inability of government to constitute an integral body which comprises above mentioned farmers body  financial institutes  KVKs  Marketing farms and government funded research institutes  If the integral body function with mutual exchange of workings with all institutional constituents  dream of  Doubling Farmers  Income  can be achieved  Let this article may draw attention of Agricultural Ministry in fulfilling its ambition,0
